# Hypha Co-op: Minecraft Office

This repository is for experimenting with having a Minecraft server as
an office for our nacent worker co-operative.

## :sparkles: Goals

- Experiment with [using Minecraft as a shared memory palace][memory-palace].
- Allow us to more easily meet "in person".
- Provide us a digital space to invest intention into before
  we have funds for a meatspace.
- Allow us to better understand the best-in-class voxel softare
  (proprietary Minecraft), before hopefully experimenting with the open
  source Minetest.
- Create a space where privacy concerns around visual representations
  are less tangled.
